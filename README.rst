Introduction
-------------

SkypeBot is a bot extended from the `sevabot project <https://github.com/opensourcehacker/sevabot>`.

It was built to act as a resource bot in a Skype group chat, collecting URLs to place in a database (see `LinkIt <https://github.com/mikemike/LinkIt/>`), and providing helpful commands for in-house projects.

This project is no longer maintained.
